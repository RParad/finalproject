# finalproject

``` 
My Final Project is an app similar to IMDB
```

### Functionality
```
The app once completed would be able to 
navigate through a database of films and actors
```
```
Currently, the app can search through the database 
and extract films that are in the database
```

### Future Goals

```
The app currently does not Add or Remove films from the database, 
this will be the next goal!
```

#### Journey so far...
```
The app has JUnit tests currently running,
Cucumber tests are currently not functioning due to system 
error but will be resolved. Selenium has been ran and the 
script for the test has been included within that app. 
Jenkins has also been implemented and triggers a test 
run upon a Push to GitHub.
```
```
The app runs via Amazon Web Services through there instances and the database also runs through RDS.
